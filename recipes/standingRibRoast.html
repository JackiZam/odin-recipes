    <p>Standing rib roast is considered by most to be the best roast out there. Certainly, it is my top choice when my grandma cooks. It has great flavor, texture, and juiciness, and it is big enough to serve many. </p>
    <p>Of couse, it is worthy to note that the roast is not a small cut of meat. It's large size and popularity make it expensive, but that makes the roast even better on those rare special occasions that it is served!
